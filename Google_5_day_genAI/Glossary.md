#### Glossary of Key Terms
- Attention Mechanism: A key component of Transformer models that allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing information.

- Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE): A subword tokenization algorithm that merges the most frequent pairs of characters or tokens to create a vocabulary of variable-length tokens.

- Chain-of-Thought Prompting: A prompting technique that encourages the LLM to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer, improving performance on complex tasks.

- Cross-Entropy Loss: A common loss function used in language modeling to measure the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution of the next token.

- Decoder: A part of the Transformer architecture responsible for generating the output sequence, often using masked self-attention.

- Embedding: A high-dimensional vector representation of a token or word that captures its semantic meaning.

- Encoder: A part of the Transformer architecture responsible for processing the input sequence into a contextualized representation.

- Fine-tuning: The process of further training a pre-trained LLM on a smaller, task-specific dataset to adapt it for a particular application.

- Few-Shot Prompting: A prompting technique that provides a few examples of the desired input-output behavior to guide the LLM.

- Flash Attention: An optimization technique that reorders attention calculations to minimize data movement between different memory tiers, significantly speeding up inference.

- Foundational Large Language Model: A large language model pre-trained on a vast amount of diverse data, capable of performing a wide range of tasks and exhibiting emergent behaviors.

- Gating Network (Router): In Mixture of Experts models, this component determines which expert(s) should process a given input.

- Knowledge Distillation: A technique to transfer knowledge from a large "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model.

- Layer Normalization: A technique used in neural networks to stabilize learning and improve performance by normalizing the activations within each layer.

- Loss Function: A function that quantifies the error between the model's predictions and the true targets during training.

- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): A parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that freezes the original weights and trains low-rank matrices to approximate weight updates.

- Masked Self-Attention: A variant of self-attention used in the decoder, which prevents each position from attending to future positions in the sequence, preserving the autoregressive property.

- Mixture of Experts (MoE): An architecture that employs multiple sub-models (experts) and a routing mechanism to improve efficiency and capacity.

- Multi-Head Attention: An extension of the self-attention mechanism that uses multiple parallel attention layers (heads) to capture different aspects of the input sequence.

- N-gram: A contiguous sequence of n items (words, tokens) from a given sample of text or speech.

- Natural Language Inference (NLI): The task of determining the logical relationship (e.g., entailment, contradiction, neutrality) between a premise and a hypothesis.

- Pre-training: The initial stage of training an LLM on a massive, general-purpose dataset to learn fundamental language patterns.

- Prefix Caching: An optimization that caches the key and value (KV) caches from previous tokens in a sequence to avoid redundant computation during subsequent inference steps.

- Prompt Engineering: The process of designing and refining text inputs (prompts) to elicit desired outputs from an LLM.

- Quantization: The process of reducing the numerical precision of a model's weights and activations to decrease memory usage and increase inference speed.

- Residual Connection: A technique in deep learning where the input of a layer is directly added to its output, helping to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem and improve training.

- Self-Attention: A mechanism within Transformer models that allows each token in a sequence to attend to all other tokens, enabling the model to understand contextual relationships.

- Softmax Function: A function that converts a vector of raw scores into a probability distribution.

- Speculative Decoding: An inference acceleration technique that uses a smaller "drafter" model to predict multiple future tokens, which are then verified in parallel by the main model.

- Tokenization: The process of breaking down a text sequence into smaller units (tokens), such as words or subwords.

- Transformer: A neural network architecture based on self-attention mechanisms, widely used for sequence modeling tasks, including natural language processing.

- Unigram Tokenization: A subword tokenization algorithm that builds a vocabulary based on the most frequent individual tokens.

- Zero-Shot Prompting: A prompting technique where the LLM is given instructions without any specific examples of the task.
