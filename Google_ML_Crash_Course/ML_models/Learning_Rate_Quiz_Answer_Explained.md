##### Suppose you are training a linear regression model and after about 100 iterations you notice that the loss is high and trending downward, but not by a significant amount. What is likely to be the problem?

###### My Answer:
- Because dataset have too many examples. The reason was I thought if learning rate too large, the model would fluctuate and never converge, so did not match trending downward with un-significant amount. While for learning rate too small, the curve would just be slowly slowly curve down and eventually converge. For dataset having too little examples, I was thinking that as the batch size = 1, which would have some noises, but still converge, just taking longer to execute because of updating weights for each example.

The situation you’re describing suggests a few potential issues that could be affecting the model’s training process:

1. **Learning Rate Too High**: If the learning rate is too high, the model might be making large updates to the parameters, causing the loss to decrease slowly or even oscillate around the minimum without converging properly. A high learning rate can prevent the model from reaching the optimal solution effectively, and the loss might decrease, but not by a significant amount. 

   **Solution**: Try lowering the learning rate and observe if the loss starts decreasing more smoothly.

2. **Insufficient Number of Iterations**: While 100 iterations might seem like a decent amount, linear regression might need more iterations to converge, especially if the learning rate is too small or the model is learning slowly.

   **Solution**: Allow for more iterations to see if the loss continues to decrease as training progresses. 

3. **Scaling Issues**: If your features aren’t normalized or standardized, the gradients might not behave well during training. Features with large differences in scale can cause problems, as the gradient updates might become skewed, slowing down convergence.

   **Solution**: Scale your features to ensure they are on a similar range, such as by using standardization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation).

4. **Model Complexity and Data Issues**: If the linear model is too simple for the data, meaning there's a non-linear relationship, the loss might not decrease significantly because the model can’t capture the complexity of the data. On the other hand, if your data is noisy, it might be causing the model to struggle.

   **Solution**: Check if a linear model is appropriate. If not, consider using a more complex model (like polynomial regression or regularized linear models). Also, ensure your data is clean and well-preprocessed.

5. **Poor Initialization**: If the model's weights were poorly initialized, it might take longer to reach a good minimum. While this is less of an issue for linear regression compared to more complex models, it's still something to consider.

   **Solution**: Re-initialize the model weights and try training again, or use a different initialization strategy.

In summary, the most likely cause is either the **learning rate** being too high or the **features needing scaling**, but it's worth experimenting with different solutions based on your specific setup.
