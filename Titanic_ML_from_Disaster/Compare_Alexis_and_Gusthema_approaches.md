| **Feature Engineering**            | Basic feature engineering (handling missing values, creating new features like "family_size").                           | Similar feature engineering with more emphasis on how TF-DF handles categorical features directly.                                               |
| **Modeling Algorithm**             | Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc. (multiple classifiers).                                                   | Decision Forests (TensorFlow Decision Forests), a tree-based model.                                                                             |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning**          | Not explicitly mentioned, although there is model evaluation and comparison.                                             | Includes detailed steps for hyperparameter tuning in TF-DF.                                                                                     |

| **Visualization**                  | Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize data and evaluation results (e.g., bar plots, heatmaps).                  | Includes visualization of the decision tree and model insights via TensorFlow tools (e.g., `tfdf.model.summary()`).                             |
| **Implementation Complexity**      | Easy to follow, suitable for beginners with basic machine learning knowledge.                                           | Slightly more advanced, assumes some knowledge of TensorFlow and tree-based models.                                                             |
| **Data Handling**                  | Focuses on cleaning and handling missing values manually, one-hot encoding categorical variables.                       | TF-DF automates some aspects of data handling (like encoding) but still includes pre-processing steps manually in some cases.                    |
| **Target Audience**                | Beginner to intermediate Kaggle users and machine learning practitioners.                                              | Intermediate to advanced users with a focus on TensorFlow and machine learning models for structured data.                                        |
